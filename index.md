# Hi. I'm Ryan Ward

I’m a lawyer and scientist who loves solving problems with data.

Given my unusual background, I approach analytics differently and love
using data to inform strategy and help make better decisions.

My personal ethics guide what I choose to work on. My work should:

- help explain information, not spread misinformation;
- be respectful and consentful, not abusing trust;
- mitigate bias and amplify missing perspectives, not propagate the status quo.

I have been almost every type of analyst – data, research, strategy, business, product, operations as well as a data scientist and ML engineer.

I also co-founded and was COO for 8 years of [Empowered Together](https://empoweredtogether.com.au){:target="\_blank"}, a charity that
educates students on sexual assault and consent.

This blog is mostly a collection of my thoughts for me to come back to. If anything here helps you
too, all the better!
