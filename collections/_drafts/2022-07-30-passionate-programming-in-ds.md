I don't usually do book reviews here but I've been reading [The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6399113-the-passionate-programmer). Is it perfect? Certainly not - despite being written only a decade ago in many aspects it's aged by what feels like a half-century especially in regards to the nature of remote work.

Regardless, there are many great take-aways and although Fowler targeted this book at software developers, I want to focus here on how some of the principles can be adopted by data specialists.

The core thesis of this book is that you should be making far more active effort to better at your job, and provides tips on how to do that. He splits it into a few areas:

1. Choosing your specialities/market
2. Investing in your skills
3. Executing effectively
4. Marketing yourself
5. Maintaining your ability

We’ll have a look at some of the best tips for data specialists in these topics.

## Choosing your specialties/market

- **Be a generalist**

  - Being a generalist means understanding a wide variety of independent areas. It can be valuable because data work is extremely varied, and if you only specialise in a specific area, say visualisation, you’ll have plenty of down-time where you could be doing other work.
  - Fowler refered to areas specific to software engineering but below are more data-specific areas I’ve considered
    - **Career type: manager or specialist** – As a data scientist, you must be able to build good models, but an exceptional employee will also have management skills to keep projects on track. Similiarly, a manager might be able to jump in when the team is under pressure for some reason and help fix some bugs in a dashboard.
    - **Platform/OS** – Regardless of personal preference, working neutrally in unison with the infrastructure of the business is critical. You might be working locally on a Mac or Windows computer and then be building ETL processes on a linux machine – being able to switch quickly between platforms and understand differences is fundamental for being a generalist.
    - **Data speciality: analytics, science, engineering, visualisation, etc** – This might be controversial but my view is that there are more commonalities than differences across these areas. For most teams if you only have a couple of data people, if you can jump from designing an A/B test, to writing some SQL to pull some data for an ad hoc request, before sharing sales metrics with the team via a dashboard, you’ll be more valuable than someone who only builds conventional neural networks and refuses to do anything else.
    - **Languages/Tools: R, Python, Excel, Tableau, etc** – R and Python come head to head quite a bit but the reality is they both deal with most of the same problems. If you join a business that uses both of these you shouldn’t bury your head in the sand about one. Similarly with Excel, it can be invaluable for sharing data with analysts who are savvy but don’t program. Visualisation tools like Tableau, Power BI, and others also cover most of the same base cases and within an organisation you should focus on being the best you can at the tools they use.
    - **Business vs data team** – It is counterproductive to think you are smarter than the business or that you can ignore the business and just do your thing. In data, you are providing a service to the business. Ultimately you are building something that helps increase revenue or reduce costs for the business. You should be trying to humbly understand more about the business.

- **Be a specialist**

  - The best point Fowler makes, perhaps in the whole book, is that too many people believe that specialising in something simply means not knowing about other things.
    - **Specialty is more than not knowing other things:** If you are a Power BI specialist, that’s not an excuse for not knowing about Tableau. And just a year of building the same bar charts in Power BI doesn’t make you a Power BI specialist. I should be able to ask you how to build bidirectional cross-filtering between data tables and you should say no problem. You should be able to tell me the difference between DAX and M without an issue. I should be able to talk about making a Sankey chart and you can tell me there is a marketplace app and you’ll show me how.
    - **Specialty is knowing the thing deeply:** Similarly, you might build classifiers with the xgboost algorithm. Do you understand how that really works? Could you explain that really simply to a business? Do you understand how they differ from other ensemble methods like random forest? If not, go and find out.
  - Look at the tools and languages you use in your day-to-day work. What areas do you not understand well? Pick the hardest area and start chipping away at your ignorance.

## Investing in your skills
