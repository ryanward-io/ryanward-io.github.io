Been working for most of the past eight years at PEXA - mostly in data roles - although did drift away for about a year working with startups and NFPs. I’m now in the data science team and looking to see if that is the right fit for me or I want to drift back towards a more engineering-intensive role. The team is building out its capability especially with the AWS Sagemaker suite of tools.

While analysis and machine learning has been interesting, the underlying architecture has been keeping me particularly enthused which is why I perhaps feel drawn down the engineering side. I'm aiming to collect more technical certificates as a good test of my knowledge here. Still - it's all good and the best roles have the autonomy to be working on a few different areas.

I'm leaning more into the open source community and looking to contribute more often both through github and meetups. I want to plan this more deliberately but my feel is that I'll aim to connect more closely with the Melbourne data community, and also restart volunteering now that I've handed on the great work of [Empowered Together](https://empoweredtogether.com.au) to a new team

I've also started more formal postgraduate education in [statistics](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/course/Graduate-Certificate-of-Applied-Statistics-GC-APPS/local). I’m looking to upskill and better describe the underlying mechanics and (ir)regularities of complex systems that are commonly found in business and, really, everywhere.
