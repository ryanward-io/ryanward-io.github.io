Puzzles. I'm addicted to solving them. I'm a beginner at setting them.

I made some puzzles for my colleagues a few months ago - a cryptic crossword (the clues involve wordplay) and a variant sudoku (sudoku with extra rules).

Online version for the sudoku here: [https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yncaqkeo](https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yncaqkeo)
No online version for the cryptic as I made it in Excel.

If you reach out I'm happy to give hints.

Otherwise, good luck! ðŸ§©
