    "### Why do I need to calculate tax?\n",
    "Calculating the tax or duty on items is a common requirement. Sometimes it is as simple as multiplying (almost) everything by 10% for a flat Value Added Tax like the Goods and Services Tax (GST). However, sometimes it is more complex and involves a sliding scale of tax based on the value of the good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Property values in Australia is an example where this sliding scale applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a property lawyer, or work in property finance you might find yourself needing to calculate stamp duty on property values. Manually doing this is painful if you have lots of properties to work through, but this is where automation helps.\n",

    "Tackling this with Python\n",

    "Looking at the Victorian Stamp Duty rates here we can extract the following parameters to calculate stamp duty."
