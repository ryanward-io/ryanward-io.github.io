Jupyter is an incredible tool for any sort of data science.

One quick tip I’m surprised I didn’t know about until recently was how to see documentation or docstrings in the Jupyter IDE.

To get straight to it, all you need to do is press `Shift and Tab` when in the code block and it will bring up the docstring for the class/method your cursor is on which can be helpful for quickly getting info.

Just a quick one – but it has saved me plenty of time.
