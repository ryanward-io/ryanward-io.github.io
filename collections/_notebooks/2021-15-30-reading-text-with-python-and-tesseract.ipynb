    "Reading text from images is a classic task that machine learning can help with. One way to solve this is obtaining thousands (or millions) of images, labeling them, and then training a classification model (e.g. Random Forest).\n",

    "### Installing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by downloading the [Tesseract compiled engine](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html). I am using the v5.0.0 binary in this article.\n",
    "2. Once downloaded move the downloaded file to an easy to access folder. I put mine in `C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/` so the executable is in `C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe`.\n",
    "3. Now you need to install the relevant python libraries. There are just two (pandas is an optional third to put the parsed text in a structured place)."

Completely misses the third line (perhaps because of the faint line through the line) and gets the fourth and fifth lines. The address in red at the bottom has a fair few errors though.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image four\n",
    "This is an example where tesseract does very well. Considering it is a cropped image of a page in a book, pretty much everywhere where it gets a full character or word it transcribes accurately. This reflects the image having words in a structured format, all similar size and with good contrast between the page and the text.\n",
