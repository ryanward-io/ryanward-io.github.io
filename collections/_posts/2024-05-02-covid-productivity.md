### During the 2020 COVID lockdowns, my partner and I wanted a busy day.  

It centred around one of the health-imposed rules - where you couldn't travel further than 5km from home except for exercise, groceries and health.  

We structured our day around exercise. Every hour, on the hour, we'd leave the house and do a 1km run. In between those runs we had a whole bunch of things from cleaning the oven, making ceramic pots, doing exercises from my physics textbook, playing some video games, and doing some cooking.  

We did it over 10 hours - running 10km. At the time it was just something fun and different but thinking about it today and it was one of the fun highlights of the lockdown.  

A diamond in the monotonous daily rough.
